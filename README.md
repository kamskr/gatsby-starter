  Gatsby's TypeScript + ESlint + Prettier starter
</h1>

This Gatsby starter is an adaptation of the default Gatsby starter with TypeScript, ESlint and Prettier added and pre-configured, bringing you everything you need to get up and running with Gatsby in a type-safe and style-safe way.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Check out this repository.**

    Use `git` to check out this repository.
    
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Tielem/gatsby-typescript-eslint-prettier-starter my-gatsby-site
    ```

    Alternatively, use Gatsby's CLI `gatsby`

    ```shell
    gatsby new https://github.com/Tielem/gatsby-typescript-eslint-prettier-starter
    ```

1.  **Change the active directory to your Gatsby site.**

    Navigate to your new site's directory.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-site/
    ```

1.  **Install the dependencies.**

    Install the dependencies of the Gatsby project with `npm` (or `yarn`).

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Start the project in development mode

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-gatsby-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in your Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    ├── renovate.json
    └── tsconfig.json

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the TypeScript code and images related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.eslintrc.json`**: This is a configuration file for [ESlint](https://eslint.org/). ESlint is a tool that helps identify potential code problems.

5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

9.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

10.  **`LICENSE`**: This starter is licensed under the MIT license.

11. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

14. **`renovate.json`**: A JSON file containing a configuration for [Renovate](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/), which keeps the dependencies up to date.

15. **`tsconfig.json`**: This is a configuration file for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). TypeScript is a programming language which adds type safety to JavaScript.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
